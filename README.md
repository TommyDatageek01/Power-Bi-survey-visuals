## Project Overview
Data is the new Oil. The use of Data in every sphere of human endeavour has spiked in the last three years. This is because Data is having more everyday application in life and industry. Data can be used to;
- Proffer solutions
- Diagonse problems
- Uncover new trends
- Predict possible outcome of a scenario and many more. 

This use of Data for different purposes has conseqquently led to emerging new careers like Data scientists, Data analysts, Data engineers and a host of others. These fields are seeing more interest by the day. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, data science and analytics jobs and skills are expected to grow significantly. In its prediction, the data field will grow between 20-35% from 2022 to 2028.
Thus, this survey visualization aims to show how Data professionals are fairing in their different niches.

## Insights
Overall, more than half of the respondent were happy with their job life, but roughly less than half were not happy with their salary. This could suggest that Data professionals do love their job but feel less compensated.

### Salary
From the data, it was discovered that Data Scientists are the happiest with their jobs with an average rating of 5.68, their work-life happiness was measured to be 6.12 (all ratings over 10).
Data Architects were second with an average score of 5.67 However their work-life happiness is 4.67.
While Data Engineer and Data Analyst had 4.34 and 4.49  happiness with salary. However, their job happiness was 5.92 and 6.00


## How do Data professionals fare in the U.S. and U.K.?
- From the survey, it was discovered that data professionals in the US have an average age of 31 while in the UK data professionals have an average age of 32
- In the US, the work and salary happiness ratings was 6.38 and 5.0 respectively for Data Professionals. While that of the UK was 5.84 and 4.05. This could probably suggest that Data professionals in the UK are less happy with their numeration compared to fellow advanced countries like the US.
Overall data professionals in the US seem to be happiest while data professionals from India seem to be the least happy.
